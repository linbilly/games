            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Big W Games is an independent tabletop studio founded by a young family with a shared passion for board games and kids' education. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Billy Lin, and I co-designed these games alongside my two sons. They are the creative engines behind Big W Games—providing the core inspiration and drawing the original artwork for our titles! What started as simple, imaginative doodles at our table eventually culminated into a series of characters, grew into a school class project, and was finally refined into the fully playable games you see today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to create games that are approachable for kids, yet deeply engaging for adults. Through extensive playtesting with our local community, we've fine-tuned our rules to ensure that every box we ship hits that perfect "easy to start, fun to master" sweet spot.
