            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <img src="robomissions.jpeg" alt="RoboMissions Game Boxes and Cards" class="rules-hero-img">
            <p>
                ROBOMissions is a strategy card game where you build armies of robots to battle other players. 
                The Missions are simple: knock out all enemy robots to claim victory!
            </p>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li>Shuffle <strong>Megabot Heads</strong> and deal one face up in front of each Player. This is their starting Megabot.</li>
                <li>Shuffle the remaining cards into a deck and place it face down on the table (the <strong>Draw Deck</strong>).</li>
                <li>Deal <strong>5 cards</strong> to each player.</li>
                <li>If the starting hand does not contain a robot, shuffle it back into the deck and re-deal.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Multiplayer Variants</h2>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Free for All:</strong> Everyone for themselves, Hunger Games style. Informal alliances and temporary truces can be made, but eventually there is only one winner. This is the most chaotic and emotionally charged play variety.</li>
                <li><strong>2V1:</strong> Two players work together to defeat a common enemy. They can coordinate moves and discuss hands, but may not trade cards or link chainbots. The one-player team gets bonuses: bigger starting hand (8 instead of 5), bigger maximum hand size (10 instead of 7) and more Actions per turn (3 instead of 2). If it becomes 1V1, the buffs stop.</li>
                <li><strong>2V2:</strong> Sit across from your teammate. After the first player is knocked out, the remaining teammate gets the 2V1 buff, draws cards until there are 8 in hand, then continues playing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Taking Turns</h2>
            <p>Pick who goes first! Play proceeds clockwise around the table. Each player gets <strong>2 Actions</strong> per turn. You can:</p>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Draw</strong> a card (grab from the Draw Deck).</li>
                <li><strong>Play</strong> a card (put it down like a boss!).</li>
                <li><strong>Repair</strong> a broken Robot Chain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Note:</em> If you have more than 7 cards in your hand at the end of your turn, discard down to 7 cards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Attacking! Pew Pew!</h2>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>First turn rule:</strong> Players CANNOT attack on their first turn. Their robots are still warming up!</li>
                <li>Play a <strong>Battery</strong> card to charge up your Megabot, Singlebot, or Chainbots and attack.</li>
                <li>Choose any opponent's robot and zap it with <strong>Attack Points (AP)</strong>!</li>
                <li>Put Damage Counters above the Robot to indicate how much damage it took.</li>
                <li>If total damage equals or exceeds its <strong>Hit Points (HP)</strong>—BOOM! It is Knocked Out and sent to the Discard Pile.</li>
                <li>Single-use battery cards go to the Used Battery Pile after being played.</li>
                <li>A robot cannot attack twice in one turn. Even robots need a break!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to Win: Last One Standing</h2>
            <p>If you have no robot on the table, you are out! Discard your hand and take a bow. The game ends when there’s only one player left (or team left). That player/team is the RoboChampion!</p>
            <h3>What if the Deck Runs Out?</h3>
            <p>If a player draws the last card, the End Game begins! Shuffle the Used Battery Pile and place it face down (this is now the Battery Draw Deck). Play continues as usual. If there’s still no winner after the End Game round, the winner is the Player with the most Robots. If tied, the biggest Megabot wins. Still tied? Shake hands!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Meet the Robots!</h2>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Chainbots (Team Power!):</strong> Tiny but mighty, they link together to form a Robot Chain. When a Battery powers one Chainbot, the entire chain attacks together! If one is Knocked Out, play a new one in the gap or use a "Repair Chain!" action to fix it.</li>
                <li><strong>Megabots (The Big Boss Bots!):</strong> Megabots get stronger by attaching Megabot Parts. You may play a part without a head, but it only has half the printed HP (or 0 if it has no HP value). A headless Megabot cannot attack. Arms can go on either side. If a Megabot's total HP hits 0, the whole Megabot is Knocked Out.</li>
                <li><strong>Singlebots (The Lone Wolves!):</strong> Independent robots that don’t need a team! Each Singlebot has a special ability that can totally change the game.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Power Up with Batteries!</h2>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Single Batteries:</strong> Powers up one attack for a Megabot, Singlebot, or Chainbot chain.</li>
                <li><strong>2 Batteries in Series (Supercharged!):</strong> Double the voltage! Every powered-up robot gets double the AP!</li>
                <li><strong>2 Batteries in Parallel (Lasting Power!):</strong> These last for TWO turns. Using them on the second turn counts as one action. If the robot is Knocked Out first, the batteries go to the Used Battery Pile.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Special Action Cards & FAQ</h2>
            <p>Do what the card says. Simple as that! Here are some common clarifications:</p>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>2 Batteries in Parallel:</strong> Using it on the second turn counts as one action.</li>
                <li><strong>Force Field:</strong> “Targeted” means attacked, chop-chopped, or having a damage counter applied by Disperse Damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Disperse Damage:</strong> The player may exchange a 50-damage counter with five 10-damage counters before dispersing them to other robots.</li>
                <li><strong>Chop Chop:</strong> Only one Megabot Part card may be removed (e.g., if a Body and an Arm are attached to a Head, only the arm can be removed).</li>
            </ul>
