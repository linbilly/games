            <p>
                MAC: March and Chomp is an abstract strategy game for two players. The objective is to strategically maneuver your pieces to capture all of your opponent’s pieces or force them into a position where they cannot make a legal move.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Components</h2>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Game Board:</strong> One 4×8 grid (32 squares).</li>
                <li><strong>Game Pieces:</strong> 30 numbered pieces (15 Red, 15 Blue). Numbered: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</li>
                <li><strong>Portal Tiles:</strong> 2 special movement tiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Tokens:</strong> Optional for more complex gameplay.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Standard Mode Rules</h2>
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li>Each player chooses a color (Red/Blue) and receives 15 pieces and one Portal Tile.</li>
                <li>Determine who goes first.</li>
                <li>Players take turns placing one of their pieces or their Portal Tile onto their 4×4 starting half of the board. All pieces and the portal must be placed.</li>
                <li>The player who placed the very first piece of the game will make the first move after all setup is complete.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gameplay & Movement Restrictions</h3>
            <p>Players alternate turns. On your turn, you must move one of your pieces one square orthogonally (up, down, left, or right).</p>
            <p>A piece may <strong>not</strong>:</p>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li>Move off the board.</li>
                <li>Move onto a square occupied by a friendly piece.</li>
                <li>Move onto a square occupied by an opposing piece of higher strength.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Capture Rules</h3>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li>A piece captures an opposing piece by moving onto its square (equal or lower strength only).</li>
                <li><strong>Special Hierarchy Rule:</strong> A Strength 1 piece defeats a Strength 10 piece. A Strength 10 piece cannot capture a Strength 1 piece.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cannon (Strength 0) Rules</h3>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>Standard Move/Capture:</strong> Moves one square orthogonally. Can capture an opponent piece of Strength 0 by moving one step.</li>
                <li><strong>Jump Capture:</strong> Can capture an opponent's piece of <em>any</em> strength by jumping over exactly one piece in a straight orthogonal line. The piece being jumped over (the "screen") is not captured.</li>
                <li>A Cannon cannot jump into a Portal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Portal Rules</h3>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li>A game piece can move one step into a Portal Tile.</li>
                <li>It immediately exits through the other Portal Tile and takes one additional, immediate orthogonal step (capturing an enemy on this final step is allowed).</li>
                <li>If no legal exit square is available, the piece cannot enter the first Portal.</li>
                <li>A Portal Tile can act as a screen piece for a Cannon's Jump Capture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>End of Game and Draw Conditions</h3>
            <ul class="rule-list">
                <li><strong>You lose if:</strong> All of your game pieces are captured, or you cannot make a legal move on your turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Draw if:</strong> The exact same board state is repeated three times, or 20 consecutive turns pass without a capture.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Optional Power Token Mode</h2>
            <p>This mode uses Power tokens to add tactical depth. Whenever one of your pieces is captured, you draw one Power token. You may play one Power token at the start of your turn before moving.</p>
